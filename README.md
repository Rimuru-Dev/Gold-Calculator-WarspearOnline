# [RimuruDev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcE4Ho3vmXj_vrg5rI7bpAA) Calculator for Warspear Online. Converting gold into rubles and vice versa.

## On the main menu of the application, you will see two buttons.
## The first button will direct you to the panel for setting the exchange rate for one thousand gold coins. By default, the exchange rate of one thousand coins is 1.7 rubles. In other words, 1k gold costs 1.7 rubles by default.
## The second button will redirect you to the calculator (converter) of gold to rubles and vice versa.
## Here you can easily convert gold into rubles or rubles into gold. When using fractional numbers, use a comma as I haven't done dot operations.
